<p> I mainly work in Artificial Intelligence and Law. My research is focussed on developing domain specific legal information retrieval systems to automate legal compliance.
I develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) systems for unstructured textual. I have developed applications for Semantic Similarity, Text Classification, Concept and Named Entity Recognition and Energy Forecasting. I mainly use scikit-learn, Gensim and NLTK for development. I also utilized TensorFlow for training word2vec and FastText embeddings for the legal corpus. </p>

        <p>This paper presents a unifying text similarity measure (USM) for automated identification of national implementations of European Union (EU) directives. The proposed model retrieves the transposed provisions of national law at a fine-grained level for each article of the directive. USM incorporates methods for matching common words, common sequences of words and approximate string matching. It was used for identifying transpositions on a multilingual corpus of four directives and their corresponding national implementing measures (NIMs) in three different languages : English, French and Italian. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods for text similarity illustrates that USM achieves a higher F-score and recall across both the corpora.</p>

        <p>This paper presents a concept recognition system for European and national legislation. Current named entity recognition (NER) systems do not focus on identifying concepts which are essential for interpretation and harmonization of European and national law. We utilized the IATE (Inter-Active Terminology for Europe) vocabulary, a state-of-the-art named entity recognition system and Wikipedia to generate an annotated corpus for concept recognition. We applied conditional random fields (CRF) to identify concepts on a corpus of European directives and Statutory Instruments (SIs) of the United Kingdom. The CRF-based concept recognition system achieved an F1 score of 0.71 over the combined corpus of directives and SIs. Our results indicate the usability of a CRF-based learning system over dictionary tagging and state-of-the-art methods.

        <p>This paper investigates the application of text similarity techniques to automatically detect the transposition of European Union (EU) directives into the national law. Currently, the European Commission (EC) resorts to time-consuming and expensive manual methods like conformity checking studies and legal analysis for identifying national transposition measures. We utilize both lexical and semantic similarity techniques and supplement them with knowledge from EuroVoc to identify transpositions. We then evaluate our approach by comparing the results with the correlation tables (gold standard). Our results indicate that both similarity techniques proved to be effective in detecting transpositions. Such systems could be used to identify the transposed provisions by both EC and legal professionals.

</a>,SAC '16, Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, Pages:2135-2141, April 2016, Pisa, Italy. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2853127" target="_blank"> Publication Link </a></p>

        <p>This paper presents an efficient model for thermal load forecast in buildings with different variations of heat load consumption across both winter and spring seasons using a Bayesian Network. The model has been validated by utilizing the realistic district heating data of three residential buildings from the district heating grid of the city of Skellefte√•, Sweden over a period of four months. The results from our model show that the current heat load consumption and outdoor temperature forecast have the most influence on the heat load forecast. Further, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for heat load forecasting by achieving a higher average accuracy of 77.97% by utilizing only 10% of the training data for a forecast horizon of 1 hour.
